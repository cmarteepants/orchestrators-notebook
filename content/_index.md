**Welcome to The Orchestrator's Notebook ðŸ”§**

Here I document insights from building data infrastructure at scale, plus my explorations into where orchestration thinking could shape the future of intelligent systems. You'll find practical insights from the trenchesâ€”everything from turning architectural bets into shipped products to navigating the messy intersection of open source innovation and enterprise adoption.

Think of this as my learning lab, where I document what works (and what doesn't) when building AI/ML systems and data infrastructure that scales with intelligence.
