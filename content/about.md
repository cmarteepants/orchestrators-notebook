## Exploring how orchestration shapes the future of data and AI systems

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Constance! I'm a Staff Product Manager at Astronomer, where I help drive strategy for Apache Airflow and the broader data orchestration ecosystem.

**What I do best:** Turning architectural bets into shipped adoption and building cross-functional alignment across complex stakeholder groups. I excel at providing clarity and strategic guidance that enables teams to execute effectively, even in ambiguous or rapidly changing environments.

I've spent the past few years leading product efforts across open source and enterprise platforms, often stepping into teams and projects that needed strategic direction and structured executionâ€”most recently driving strategy and leading key efforts for Airflow 3.

**What I'm exploring:** How orchestration principles from the data world apply to AI/ML platforms, and what it takes to build infrastructure that scales with intelligence. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of runtime, UX, and scaleâ€”where technical architecture meets user experience.

My work focuses on bridging the gap between open source innovation and enterprise adoption. I regularly speak at conferences and engage with enterprise customers, helping translate cutting-edge concepts into production-ready solutions.
